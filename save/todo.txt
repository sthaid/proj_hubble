define MAX_GALAXY   1e6
MAX_GALAXY_XY    100
MAX_GALAXY_Z     .873     MAX_GALAXY_XY * tan(0.5)

create the galaxy and sort them by distance, so we only need to loop over the first to display them

create linked list for each 1 degree telescope direction
- these will be sorted by distance

display all galaxys
- and just for telescoep azimuth 0

axiumth to idx
  az in range 0 to 359.99
  .5 to 1.5  => 1
  (floor)(az + .5) 
  if (idx == 360) idx = 0




-----------

start building pgm
- utils  for sdl
- include plots
    sf
    h
    diameter
