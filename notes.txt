SCALE FACTOR & HUBBLE CONSTANT
=======================================

--------------------------------------------

Ho = 70 (km/s)/Mpc   
- kilometers per sec per Megaparsec
- Ho is the hubble constant now
- H is time dependent Hubble Parameter

Converting hubble constant to SI units
- 3.1e22 meters / megaparsec
- Ho = 70 * 1000 / 3.1e22 = 2.25 e-18 /sec

a is the scale factor of the universe. 
- the scale factor (a) equals 1 now

  "Universe becomes transparent. Temperature is T=3000 K, time is 380,000 years 
   after the Big Bang. Ordinary matter can now fall into the dark matter clumps. 
   The CMB travels freely from this time until now, so the CMB anisotropy gives 
   a picture of the Universe at this time."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "Wienâ€™s Displacement Law, which states that the frequency of the peak of the 
   emission (fmax) increases linearly with absolute temperature (T). Conversely, 
   as the temperature of the body increases, the wavelength at the emission 
   peak decreases."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "Observations by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based instruments show that 
   the first galaxies took shape as little as one billion years after the Big Bang, 
   which probably took place about 13 billion to 14 billion years ago."

SUMMARY
-------

Scale factor in matter and dark energy dominated eras:
- matter dominated era        47,000     9.8 Byrs    a = k * t ^ (2/3)
- dark energy dominated era   9.8 Byrs   forever     a = k * exp(H * t)   

Universe becomes transparent
- time = .000380 byr  (380,000 years after the big bang)
- temperature = 3000 k
- using Wien Displacement Law, applied to CMB, 
  the scale factor of universe at time=.00038 byr ...
          a(.00038)       2.7
          ---------  = ---------        a(.00038) = 2.7/3000 = 0.0009
          a(now)         3000
